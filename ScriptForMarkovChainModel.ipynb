    "The perturbations are defined by flipping a state from 0 to 1 or from 1 to zero at the initial state and following that new perturbed state after 1000 iterations to see at what basin it reached using the same adjecency matrix. The single perturbation is done for all genes found in each state and the resullting probability is a fraction (# perturbed state reached state basin n)/(# of genes) for all basin found in the network. Further, there can be two flippings of a state, two genes switching from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0, and there can be three flippings and four and n for n genes. Thus this following algorithm assigns the probability of 1....n flippings based on the binomial coefficient while assuming that the probability of flipping is very small 0.01  "
